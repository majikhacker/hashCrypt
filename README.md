**Description:**

This Python script implements a text translator that converts input text into a custom language based on a predefined mapping of characters. The script allows users to input text and receive the translated output, with each character replaced according to the specified mapping rules.

**Features:**

- **Custom Language Mapping:** The script defines a custom mapping of characters to their corresponding replacements in the custom language. For example, the letter 'A' may be replaced with 'E', and so on.
- **Case Insensitivity:** The mapping supports both uppercase and lowercase characters, ensuring consistent translation regardless of input case.
- **Translation Function:** The script defines a translator function that applies the custom mapping to input text, replacing each character with its corresponding translation.
- **Interactive Interface:** Users can interactively input text to be translated, with the option to exit the translation loop by typing 'exit'.

**Usage:**

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter text to be translated when prompted, or type 'exit' to quit the translation loop.
3. View the translated output, which will display the input text converted into the custom language based on the predefined mapping.

**Customization:**

- To modify the custom language mapping, update the `custom_mapping` dictionary with the desired character replacements.
- For more complex translation rules or additional functionalities, modify the `create_translator` function as needed.

**Dependencies:**

- None (pure Python script)

**Note:** This script serves as a basic example of implementing a simple text translator in Python. It can be further extended and customized with additional features, such as support for punctuation, special characters, or multiple translation mappings.
